The [Events by Unlock Labs](https://events.unlock-protocol.com/) page has an updated, modern and fresh look!

There are a number of changes included with the redesign:

- Cover image
- Walletless RSVP
- URL slugs for your event page (this also applies to [certifications](https://certifications.unlock-protocol.com)!)

## Cover image

You now have the option to add a cover image for your event page! Simply click the `Upload Image` button and follow the steps from the modal.

Once the modal is open, you can pick an image or set the URL to see the preview; if you are done, you can just click `Save` and be done!

Once saved, the image will be set as the cover image for your events page.
You can change it anytime you want by following the previous steps.

## Walletless RSVP

The walletless, RSVP-by-email form is now visible when on the side of the event's details.

## Custom URL slugs

Great news â€” you can now define a custom slug for your events page. Instead of a long URL, you can now specify a much shorter URL for your event.
