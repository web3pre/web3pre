# web3pre

web3pre is a scaffold2 based (quite literally) app for issuring tickets and redeeming them for use to be able to view a zoom event.
Because this project uses web2 centralized services like Zoom, we believe we can raise adoption by making web2 things more safe and transparent.

This project makes use of the following technologies:

## Live url: http://18.237.73.29/example-ui

#### TODO: buildl support for more than 1 concurrent meeting.
#### TODO: buildl support jitsi.
#### TODO: buildl zoom native app, replace pipedream.



## Chain: Base (mainnet)
f'it we do it live!
## Token Gate: Unlock Protocol
Uses the minting of locks and keys, and signing events against them
## WalletMessaging: XMTMP
Because it was built into Coinbase Wallet, and useful to implement for client messaging.
